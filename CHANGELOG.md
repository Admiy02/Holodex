- Isolated Stream-Translations chat built into Mobile and Desktop views, you can also get Live-TL-esque features on Mobile (and desktop).
- Massive improvements to mobile experience.
- Removed top status bar from the App version of the website, but may require a reinstall for some platforms.
- Added Music Player / Music Curation platform. You can browse, search, and listen to karaoke streams / covers as if it is Spotify.

Everyone can contribute and create music annotations, so feel free to help out your oshi by tagging their karaoke songs.
